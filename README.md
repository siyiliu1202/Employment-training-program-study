# Repository for employment training program study

This repo contains files for the paper "The Effect of Employee Training Programs on Employee Income".

It is organised as follows:

The "paper" folder within the "outputs" folder contains the R Markdown document, `paper.Rmd` that produces the PDF file of the paper. The PDF file is `paper.PDF`. 

The "inputs" folder contain two subfolders: "data" and "literature". 

- The "data" folder can be used to store raw data from external sources. The analysis dataset can be loaded with a `R` package thus this folder is currently empty, but it can be used to store other data if necessary. 

- The "literature" folder can be used to store papers, articles or books relevant to our study. 

The "scripts" folder can be used to contain `.R` scripts for data cleaning. Since the analysis dataset only required very minimal data cleaning, a separate script was not used. 

To run or modify analysis `R` code, open the `R` project `employee training program.Rproj` and access the files within the project.
